Question 4:

A)	Association
	dependency
	
B) 

BigBinary b=new BigBinary();
List<Bit> list=b.getBits();
System.out.println(list==b.getBits);

C)

Yes because you are returning a copy of the Bit


D)

1. if a is an object of BigBinary and **BigBinary b=a;** then this==obj and equals returns false
2. a is bigbinary number 000000000001 and b is bigbinary number 000 throws index out of bounds
3. is a is a valid bigbinary number but b is null
4. a is bigbinary number 000 b is bigbinary number 0001
